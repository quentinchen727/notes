## Git diff
git diff compares the difference between working dir and local repo
There are three versions of files:
    1. working files, normal files to work with;
    2. index files for git, actually hash of files. The copy of files are stored as blobs.
    3. commit files for git, ditto.

In vim-fugitive, Git diff bring up the staged version of the file side by side with the working tree version.
